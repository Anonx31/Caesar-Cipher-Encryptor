# Caesar Cipher Encryptor

## Description
Caesar Cipher Encryptor is a simple GUI-based encryption tool built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher algorithm, a basic form of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
- User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter
- Encrypt text by shifting letters forward
- Decrypt text by shifting letters backward
- Adjustable shift value for encryption and decryption
- Support for uppercase and lowercase letters
- Basic input validation to prevent errors

## Installation
To run the Caesar Cipher Encryptor, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using:

bash
pip install tkinter


## Usage
Run the script using the following command:

bash
python caesar_cipher.py


1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Choose the shift value.
3. Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to get the result.
